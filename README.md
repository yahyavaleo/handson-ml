This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the book: [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

## Requirements

The Jupyter notebooks requires a Python environment with the following packages installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Structure

For each chapter, the theoretical questions are solved in a Markdown file as `exercises.md`, while the questions that requires code to be written are solved in a Jupyter notebook. These Jupyter notebooks are mostly named after the dataset used in the exercises, such as `mnist.ipynb`.
